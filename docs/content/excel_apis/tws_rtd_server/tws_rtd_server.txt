/*! \page tws_rtd_server RTD Server for Excel		\section rtd_introduction Introduction		TWS RTD Server API is a dynamic link library which allows user to request real-time market data from TWS via API using Microsoft Excel®. 	The TWS RTD Server API directly uses the C# API Client source, which connects to TWS via the socket. It allows displaying streaming live (or 15-minute delayed) market data in Excel by entering formulas into an Excel cell following a specific syntax.		<b>Note: </b>At the current stage, only top-level market data is supported via TWS RTD Server API. No trading capability or other data types are supported. Both Delayed and Real-Time data are supported via TWS RTD Server API. 	\ref market_subscriptions "Market Data Subscription" is required for requesting live streaming market data.	<br>		\section rtd_what_you_will_need What You Will Need		\subsection rtd_req_env - Windows Operating System		Since the TWS RTD Server API technology directly refers to the C# API client source functions, it is supported on <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1658&nhf=T" target="_blank">Windows Environment</a> only.		\subsection rtd_req_api - API version 9.73.03+		You need to download <a href="http://interactivebrokers.github.io/" target="_blank">IB API</a> Windows version 9.73.03 or higher and install on your computer. Once you have installed the API, you can verify the API Version by checking <i>C:\\TWS API\API_VersionNum.txt</i> by default.		\subsection rtd_req_tws - TWS (or IB Gateway) Build 963+		By default, market data requests sent via TWS RTD Server will automatically request for all possible \ref rtd_simple_syntax_gen_ticks. There are several generic tick types being requested that are only supported in TWS 963 or higher. 	Sending any RTD market data request with default generic tick list to an old build of TWS will trigger a "TwsRtdServer error" indicating incorrect generic tick list is sent. Make sure a <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=14099#tws-software" target="_blank">TWS builds 963+</a> is downloaded from IB website and kept running at the background for TWS RTD Server API to function properly.		\subsection rtd_req_socket - Enable Socket Client in TWS (or IB Gateway)		Since the TWS RTD Server API directly refers to the C# API source, RTD market data requests will be sent via the socket layer. Please make sure to \ref enable_api "Enable ActiveX and Socket Client" settings in your TWS. 		Please also be mindful of the socket port that you configure in your TWS API settings. The default socket port TWS will listen on is <b>7496</b> for a live session, and <b>7497</b> for a paper session. 	It is further discussed in section \ref rtd_simple_syntax_conn that TWS RTD Server connects to port <b>7496</b> by default, and you are able to customize the port number to connect by specifying pre-defined \ref rtd_simple_syntax_conn or using rtd_complex_syntax string "port=<port>". 	You can use any valid port for connection as you wish, and you just need to make sure that the port you are trying to connect to via the API is the same port your TWS is listening on.		\subsection rtd_req_excel - Microsoft Excel®		After installing the API, the pre-compiled RTD library file (located at <i>C:\\TWS API\source\csharpclient\TwsRtdServer\bin\Release\TwsRtdServer.dll</i> by default) registered on your computer will be in 32-bit by default. If you are using 64-bit Microsoft Excel, you would need to re-compile RTD server dll file into 64-bit and register the library by re-building the RTD source solution using Visual Studio. 	Please refer to the <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7412660386944689921" target="_blank">TWS Excel APIs, featuring the RealTimeData Server</a> recorded webinar for detailed instructions.		\section rtd_syntax_headline TWS RTD Server Formula Syntax		Customer can request market data by entering the following formula with corresponding parameters into an Excel spreadsheet cell:		<DFN class="rtd_formula">	=RTD(<b>ProgID</b>, <b>Server</b>, <b>String1</b>, <b>String2</b>, ...)	</DFN>		where		 - <b>ProgID</b> = "Tws.TwsRtdServerCtrl"	 - <b>Server</b> = \"\" (empty string)	 - <b>String1</b>, <b>String2</b>, ... is a list of strings representing <b>Ticker</b>, <b>Topic</b>, <b>Connection Parameters</b> or other <b>Complex Syntax</b> strings. 	 	 <i><b>Note: </b>TWS RTD Server API formula is <b>not</b> case-sensitive.</i>		There are three ways to compose an RTD Formula:		 - \subpage rtd_simple_syntax	 - \subpage rtd_complex_syntax	 - \subpage rtd_mixed_syntax	 	\section rtd_examples_headline Syntax Samples		A resourceful \subpage rtd_examples "Syntax Samples" page is provided for demonstration of RTD formulas categorized by security type using different syntaxs. 	 - \ref rtd_samples_fx	 - \ref rtd_samples_stk	 - \ref rtd_samples_ind	 - \ref rtd_samples_cfd	 - \ref rtd_samples_fut	 - \ref rtd_samples_opt	 - \ref rtd_samples_fop	 - \ref rtd_samples_bond	 - \ref rtd_samples_fund	 - \ref rtd_samples_cmdty	 - \ref rtd_samples_spread	 	Besides reading through the written documentation, you can also watch the <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7412660386944689921" target="_blank">TWS Excel APIs, featuring the RealTimeData Server</a> recorded webinar for a more interactive tutorial video.	 	\section rtd_throttle_headline Change Data Refresh Rate		 - \subpage rtd_throttle	 	\section rtd_fqa_errors_headline Troubleshooting Common Errors		 - \subpage rtd_fqa_errors "Troubleshooting Common Errors"		<br><br>*/
