/*! \page error_handling Error Handling

	When a client application sends a message to TWS which requires a response which has an expected response (i.e. placing an order, requesting market data, subscribing to account updates, etc.), TWS will almost either always <b>1)</b> respond with the relevant data or <b>2)</b> send an error message to IBApi::EWrapper::error. 
	
	- <b>Exceptions when no response can occur</b>: If a market data request is made during a competing session (when a paper user is logged into simultaneously on a different computer from the associated live user) there is not currently a message returned from TWS. Also, if a request is made prior to full establishment of connection (denoted by a returned 2104 or 2106 error code <i>"Data Server is Ok"</i>), there may not be a response from the request. 
	
	Error messages sent by the TWS are handled by the @ref IBApi::EWrapper::error method. The @ref IBApi::EWrapper::error event contains the originating request Id (or the orderId in case the error was raised when placing an order), a numeric error code and a brief description. It is important to keep in mind that this function is used for <i>true</i> error messages as well as notifications that do not mean anything is wrong. 
	
	<b>API Error Messages when TWS is not set to the English Language</b>
	
	- Currently on the Windows platform, error messages are sent using Latin1 encoding. If TWS is launched in a non-Western language, it is recommended to enable the setting at Global Configuration -> API -> Settings to "Show API error messages in English".
