	A <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=602">Market</a> order is an order to buy or sell at the market bid or offer price. A market order may increase the likelihood of a fill 
	and the speed of execution, but unlike the Limit order a Market order provides no price protection and may fill at a price far 
	lower/higher than the current displayed bid/ask.

	A <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=600">Market If Touched</a> (MIT) is an order to
	buy (or sell) a contract below (or above) the market. Its purpose is to take advantage 
	of sudden or unexpected changes in share or other prices and provides investors with a trigger price to set an order in motion. 
    Investors may be waiting for excessive strength (or weakness) to cease, which might be represented by a specific price point. 
    MIT orders can be used to determine whether or not to enter the market once a specific price level has been achieved. This order 
    is held in the system until the trigger price is touched, and is then submitted as a market order. An MIT order is similar to a 
    stop order, except that an MIT sell order is placed above the current market price, and a stop sell order is placed below

	A <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=616">pegged-to-market order</a> is designed to maintain a purchase price relative to the national best offer (NBO) or a sale price 
	 relative to the national best bid (NBB). Depending on the width of the quote, this order may be passive or aggressive. 
	 The trader creates the order by entering a limit price which defines the worst limit price that they are willing to accept. 
	 Next, the trader enters an offset amount which computes the active limit price as follows:
		 Sell order price = Bid price + offset amount
		 Buy order price = Ask price - offset amount

	 continually adjusts the option order price by the product of a signed user-define delta and the change of 
	 the option's underlying stock price. The delta is entered as an absolute and assumed to be positive for calls and negative for puts. 
	 A buy or sell call order price is determined by adding the delta times a change in an underlying stock price to a specified starting 
	 price for the call. To determine the change in price, the stock reference price is subtracted from the current NBBO midpoint. 
	 The Stock Reference Price can be defined by the user, or defaults to the NBBO midpoint at the time of the order if no reference price 
	 is entered. You may also enter a high/low stock price range which cancels the order when reached. The delta times the change in stock 
	 price will be rounded to the nearest penny in favor of the order.

	 <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=613">Relative</a> (a.k.a. Pegged-to-Primary) 
	 orders provide a means for traders to seek a more aggressive price than the National Best Bid 
	 and Offer (NBBO). By acting as liquidity providers, and placing more aggressive bids and offers than the current best bids and offers, 
	 traders increase their odds of filling their order. Quotes are automatically adjusted as the markets move, to remain aggressive. 
	 For a buy order, your bid is pegged to the NBB by a more aggressive offset, and if the NBB moves up, your bid will also move up. 
	 If the NBB moves down, there will be no adjustment because your bid will become even more aggressive and execute. For sales, your 
	 offer is pegged to the NBO by a more aggressive offset, and if the NBO moves down, your offer will also move down. If the NBO moves up, 
	 there will be no adjustment because your offer will become more aggressive and execute. In addition to the offset, you can define an 
	 absolute cap, which works like a limit price, and will prevent your order from being executed above or below a specified level.

	 moves up, your bid will also move up. If the NBB moves down, there will be no adjustment because your bid will become aggressive and execute. 
	 For a sell order, your price is pegged to the NBO by a less aggressive offset, and if the NBO moves down, your offer will also move down. 
	 If the NBO moves up, there will be no adjustment because your offer will become aggressive and execute. In addition to the offset, you can 
	 define an absolute cap, which works like a limit price, and will prevent your order from being executed above or below a specified level. 
	 The Passive Relative order is similar to the Relative/Pegged-to-Primary order, except that the Passive relative subtracts the offset from 
	 the bid and the Relative adds the offset to the bid.

	 A <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1058">pegged-to-midpoint</a> order provides a means for traders to seek a price at the midpoint of the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). 
	 The price automatically adjusts to peg the midpoint as the markets move, to remain aggressive. For a buy order, your bid is pegged to 
	 the NBBO midpoint and the order price adjusts automatically to continue to peg the midpoint if the market moves. The price only adjusts 
	 to be more aggressive. If the market moves in the opposite direction, the order will execute.

	 A <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=609">Stop</a> 
	 order is an instruction to submit a buy or sell market order if and when the user-specified stop trigger price is attained or 
	 penetrated. A Stop order is not guaranteed a specific execution price and may execute significantly away from its stop price. A Sell 
	 Stop order is always placed below the current market price and is typically used to limit a loss or protect a profit on a long stock 
	 position. A Buy Stop order is always placed above the current market price. It is typically used to limit a loss or help protect a 
	 profit on a short sale.

	 to trigger at a specified stop price. When the stop price is penetrated, the order is triggered as a market with protection order, 
	 which means that it will fill within a specified protected price range equal to the trigger price +/- the exchange-defined protection 
	 point range. Any portion of the order that does not fill within this protected range is submitted as a limit order at the exchange-defined 
	 trigger price +/- the protection points.

	\section trailingstop Trailing Stop
	 A sell <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=605">trailing stop</a> 
	 order sets the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price with an attached "trailing" amount. As the 
	 market price rises, the stop price rises by the trail amount, but if the stock price falls, the stop loss price doesn't change, 
	 and a market order is submitted when the stop price is hit. This technique is designed to allow an investor to specify a limit on the 
	 maximum possible loss, without setting a limit on the maximum possible gain. "Buy" trailing stop orders are the mirror image of sell 
	 trailing stop orders, and are most appropriate for use in falling markets.
	 
	 Note that Trailing Stop orders can have the trailing amount specified as a percent, as in the example below, or as an absolute amount which is specified in the auxPrice field.

	\section trailingstoplimit Trailing Stop Limit
	 A <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=606">trailing stop limit</a> 
	 order is designed to allow an investor to specify a limit on the maximum possible loss, without setting a limit 
	 on the maximum possible gain. A SELL trailing stop limit moves with the market price, and continually recalculates the stop trigger 
	 price at a fixed amount below the market price, based on the user-defined "trailing" amount. The limit order price is also continually 
	 recalculated based on the limit offset. As the market price rises, both the stop price and the limit price rise by the trail amount and 
	 limit offset respectively, but if the stock price falls, the stop price remains unchanged, and when the stop price is hit a limit order 
	 is submitted at the last calculated limit price. A "Buy" trailing stop limit order is the mirror image of a sell trailing stop limit, 
	 and is generally used in falling markets.
	 
	 Trailing Stop Limit orders can be sent with the trailing amount specified as an absolute amount, as in the example below, or as a percentage, specified in the trailingPercent field. 
	
	<b>Important:</b> the 'limit offset' field is set by default in the TWS/IBG settings in v963+. This setting either needs to be changed in the Order Presets, the default value accepted, or the limit price offset sent from the API as in the example below. Not both the 'limit price' and 'limit price offset' fields can be set in TRAIL LIMIT orders.

	 <a target="_blank" class="linkexternal" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=604">Volatility-type</a> 
	 orders for options and combinations rather than price orders. 
	 Option traders may wish to trade and position for movements in the price of the option determined by its implied volatility. Because 
	 implied volatility is a key determinant of the premium on an option, traders position in specific contract months in an effort to take 
	 advantage of perceived changes in implied volatility arising before, during or after earnings or when company specific or broad market 
	 volatility is predicted to change. In order to create a Volatility order, clients must first create a Volatility Trader page from the 
	 Trading Tools menu and as they enter option contracts, premiums will display in percentage terms rather than premium. The buy/sell process 
	 is the same as for regular orders priced in premium terms except that the client can limit the volatility level they are willing to pay or 
	 receive.
