<div class="textblock"><p>The TWS uses the <a class="el" href="interfaceIBApi_1_1EWrapper.html#a7dfc221702ca65195609213c984729b8">IBApi.EWrapper.error</a> method not only to deliver errors but also warnings or informative messages. This is done mostly for simplicity's sake. Below is a table with all the messages which can be sent by the TWS/IB Gateway. All messages delivered by the TWS are usually accompanied by a brief but meaningful description pointing in the direction of the problem.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="system_codes"></a>
System Message Codes</h1>
<p>Remember that the TWS API simply connects to a running TWS/IB Gateway which most of times will be running on your local network if not in the same host as the client application. It is your responsibility to provide reliable connectivity between the TWS and your client application.</p>
<p>The messages in the table below are not a consequence of any action performed by the client application. They are notifications about the connectivity status between the TWS and itself and our servers. Your client application must pay special attention to them and handle the situation accordingly. You are very likely to loose connectivity to our servers at least once a day due to our daily server maintenance downtime as clearly detailed in our <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Fsoftware%2FsystemStatus.php" target="_blank" class="linkexternal">Current System Status</a> page. Note that after the system reset, the TWS/IB Gateway will automatically reconnect to our servers and you can resume your operations normally.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> during a reset period, there may be an interruption in the ability to log in or manage orders. Existing orders (native types) will operate normally although execution reports and simulated orders will be delayed until the reset is complete. It is not recommended to operate during the scheduled reset times.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="client_codes"></a>
Client Error Codes</h1>
<p>Client errors are those occurring purely on the TWS API client code and as such they are never sent by the TWS. They are mostly errors happening when validating messages before these are sent to the TWS and you are unlikely to receive the vast majority of them. As such only a small list of these errors is documented below. To see all available errors of this type please refer to the <a class="el" href="classIBApi_1_1EClientErrors.html">IBApi.EClientErrors</a> class.</p>

Refer to the TWS' API Settings as explained in the error message. See also <a class="el" href="connection.html">Connection</a>   </td></tr>
