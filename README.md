This repository is a unofficial clone of the original tws-api published by Interactive Brokers, stripped down to the bare C# components and compiled in `dotnet standard`. Use this code to interact with TWS through a socket. For a higher level API to interact with TWS, see the [downstream repository](https://github.com/amittleider/AutoFinance.Broker).
