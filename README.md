## Readme
This repository is a clone of the original tws-api published by Interactive Brokers, stripped down to the bare C# components and compiled in `dotnet standard`. The original can be found here http://interactivebrokers.github.io/ . Linux users can now use the CSharp API in their dotnet standard or dotnet core projects to connect to TWS or the Gateway. Interactive brokers does not want to commit this to their repository because they do not want their users to be forced to download a new framework. The may stay on NET 4.5 forever.
