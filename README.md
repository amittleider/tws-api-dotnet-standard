## Readme
This repository is a clone of the original tws-api published by Interactive Brokers. The original can be found here http://interactivebrokers.github.io/ . This code allows a connection to TWS or the Gateway through various languages. In this repository, the CSharp interface is modified to use `dotnet standard`. Linux users can now use the CSharp API in their dotnet standard or dotnet core projects to connect to TWS or the Gateway. Interactive brokers does not want to commit this to their repository because they do not want their users to be forced to download a new framework. The may stay on NET 4.5 forever.
