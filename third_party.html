<div class="textblock"><p>Third party software vendors make use of the TWS' programming interface (API) to integrate their platforms with Interactive Broker's. Thanks to the TWS API, well known platforms such as Ninja Trader or Multicharts can interact with the TWS to fetch market data, place orders and/or manage account and portfolio information.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of third party platforms implementing our interface can be found in our <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/MarketPlace.MarketPlaceServlet" target="_blank" class="linkexternal">Investor's Marketplace</a>. As stated in the marketplace, the vendors' list is in no way a recommendation from Interactive Brokers. If you are interested in a given platform that is not listed, please contact the platform's vendor directly for further information.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="third_party_faq"></a>
Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Below is a list of frequently asked questions. All answers are given considering a standard usage of the TWS. Note that some vendors might provide an additional customisation level to simplify things. If the below description does not reflect the way you operate your third party software with the TWS, please contact your vendor directly.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_faq_connect"></a>
How to connect a 3rd party platform to Interactive Brokers' Trader Workstation</h2>
<p>Connecting any third party program to the TWS requires you to enable API connectivity on the TWS itself as explained in <a class="el" href="initial_setup.html#enable_api">Enable API connections</a> section. Your third party program will need to provide means for you to specify at least a <b>host</b> and a <b>port</b>. In the vast majority of cases the third party program will be running on the exact same computer as the TWS therefore the host IP can be specified as <b>127.0.0.1</b> whereas the port needs to be the exact same as the one configured in the TWS' API Settings, typically <b>7496</b> or <b>7497</b>. Below is an illustration showing one of our API sample applications highlighting the typical connectivity fields a program connecting to the TWS should provide. Note there is an additional field for "clientId". You can set this id to any positive integer including zero or to whatever your third party application's provider recommends.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> for vendor-specific instructions please contact your third party provider directly.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="sample_app_connect.png" alt="sample_app_connect.png"/>
</div>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_support"></a>
Where to get support for a third party software connecting to the TWS.</h2>
<p>Interactive Brokers cannot provide any kind of support or advice for software not developed by IB itself. Depending on the nature of your inquiry, our support staff's advice might be quite limited since in most of cases it is not realistic to reverse-engineer a third party program in order to understand how is it using our API. Because of this, the third party vendor's support team should always be the first contact option.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_ping_pong"></a>
My program's vendor did not find any issue on its side and asked me to contact Interactive Brokers directly.</h2>
<p>There will be occasions when a given operation will not be fulfilled as expected not because of a malfunction in either platform but because of the business logic involved. The typical behaviour of the TWS is to either perform the requested operation or to return an explanatory message which will point you in the right direction. It is the duty of the third party program to clearly show these TWS' messages within its own user interface. Without a relevant error message our support team will not be able to give any advice.</p>
<p>In case of a malfunction on Interactive Broker's side, clear and concise technical information needs to be provided including evidence of the malfunction in the form of TWS or API message log files as detailed in <a class="el" href="support.html#tws_logs">The TWS log</a> section of this guide. Collecting all the needed information is not a trivial process and might require a very detailed knowledge of our API. To prevent being caught in between support teams, please request your third party vendor to contact us directly via email to <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'api'+'@i'+'nte'+'ra'+'cti'+'ve'+'bro'+'ke'+'rs.'+'co'+'m'; return false;">api@i<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>nter<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>activ<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>ebro<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>kers.<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>com</a> with as much information as possible.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_data"></a>
I cannot see any market data in my third party program</h2>
<p>As explained in our <a class="el" href="market_data.html">Market Data</a> page, in order to be able to pull market data from the TWS, you need to acquire the <a class="el" href="market_data.html#market_subscriptions">Live Data Subscriptions</a> of the product(s) you are interested in.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_data_sharing"></a>
I do have the Live Data Subscriptions I need but when using my paper trading user name I am still unable to obtain it.</h2>
<p>Make sure you are <a class="el" href="market_data.html#paper_sharing">Sharing Market Data Subscriptions</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_pacing_violation"></a>
I am obtaining a message saying "Historical data request pacing violation"</h2>
<p>Please refer to our <a class="el" href="historical_limitations.html">Historical Data Limitations</a> page</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_no_eod"></a>
My third party program shows "No data of type EODChart is available" when trying to load a chart</h2>
<p>This message is returned when the requested End of Day (EOD) market data is not available in our systems. You can easily verify this by loading the exact same chart using the TWS to obtain the same result:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="no_eod_data.png" alt="no_eod_data.png"/>
</div>
<p>Please contact our General Support team's Market Data department for further information.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_no_data"></a>
I am obtaining a "HMDS query returned no data" message.</h2>
<p>Sometimes the data prior to the specified requested date is also not available for several reasons. Suppose a product started quoting (generating data) on 1st January 2016 but your third party program requests data prior to this date. To prevent this error message adjust your third party program's charting parameters accordingly.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_cfd_charting"></a>
I cannot chart CFDs from my third party program yet the TWS shows the data correctly.</h2>
<p>Except for <b>Index CFDs</b>, CFDs do not have any market data of their own. What the TWS displays is the CFD's <b>underlying contract's</b> data. Whenever you try to fetch non-Index CFD data from the TWS, you will obtain an error message asking you to pull it's underlying contract's data instead. Some third party programs' user interface only allow placing orders via their charts. Given that no data can be loaded for these products and the impossibility of the third party program to apply a similar conversion as the TWS, you might find your third party software not able to place orders as a consequence!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_paper_trading"></a>
How can I connect my third party program to my paper trading account?</h2>
<p>Connections via the TWS API are not aware of the user name with which you are logged in with in your TWS. From this point of view the API makes no difference between live or paper trading. Since third party programs only connect any running TWS on the specified host and port it only takes you to launch the TWS and log into it with your paper trading credentials, make sure you <a class="el" href="initial_setup.html#enable_api">Enable API connections</a> and connect to it from your third party application using the same procedure.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_paper_with_live"></a>
Can I connect simultaneously to my live and paper TWS?</h2>
<p>From our side, yes. You can launch as many instances of the TWS as you need using different user name/password combinations. It is crucial though to make sure each TWS is listening on a different <b>port</b> as described in the <a class="el" href="initial_setup.html#enable_api">Enable API connections</a> section. Note that your might as well need to launch multiple instances of your third party program and/or have a way of telling when is your program using the paper or the live accounts.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="tp_data_mismatch"></a>
The charts shown by my charting software differ from the ones shown by the TWS</h2>
<p>Given that the historical data sent down the TWS API comes from the same source as the one displayed by the TWS itself it is almost impossible for it to differ.</p>
<p>Some charting platforms circumvent our <a class="el" href="historical_limitations.html">Historical Data Limitations</a> by combining real time and historical data. Since our real time market data is <b>not</b> tick-by-tick, bars built from it will hardly match those retrieved from our historical market data service.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might as well be comparing different charts without noticing. A chart displaying data from NYSE will never be the same as another built from the ARCA exchange or from our SMART routing strategy. inadvertently you might as well be looking at TRADES on one side while having MIDPOINT or BID_ASK on another. Another common mistake involves having different timezones between the TWS and your client application.</p>
